Random Password Generator:

When user clicks the "Generate Password" button they will be met with a series of prompts and confirmations.
Durinng which, the user will:

- Enter their desired password length between 8 - 128 characters. 
- Confirm whether they want their password to include lowercase letters.
- Confirm whether they want their password to include uppercase letters.
- Confirm whether they want their password to include numbers.
- Confirm whether they want their password to include special characters.

Once the user has completed confirming their choices, the password will be generated into the text box.
Loops were used to ensure the password contains at least 1 of each selected character type. Any random 
passwords generated NOT containing the desired character types would trigger the conditional 
statements, forcing a new password to be generated until the selected criteria is met.
